# Machine Learning Resource Box
Here's a repository that you always wanted! We've compiled a list of resources that WE think can aid you best in your learning of Machine Learning. 

## What is Machine Learning?
It's the cutting edge of Computer Programming. You write programs that allow software applications to become more accurate in predicting systems outcomes without being explicitly programmed.Fun isn't it?

## Software Requirements:
* Anaconda Prompt [Link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* After installing prompt enter the following commands:
  * ```pip install pandas```
  * ```pip install numpy```
  * ```pip install skypy```
  * ```pip install seaborn```
  * ```pip install matplotlib```
  * ```pip install sklearn```

## What can you do after learning ML?

Once you have the basics down, ramp up your skills by applying ML techniques to big data-sets in real-world applications. Other paths take you further into data science, and innovative ML approaches like deep learning,Reinforcement Learning and Generational Neural Networks.

### Any of these: 
  * Deep Learning Specialization [Link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
  * Introduction to Reinforcement Learning(Google DeepMind) [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ)

## The Books Which can Help You Out in Moving Forward?

As most of the Courses are done on Research Software like R,Octave.These books can help you do the same on Python which is a commercially used machine learning language

### Any of these:
* Sebastian Raschka python machine learning-This is one of the most referred book for Machine Learning Concepts and Implementation.

## Which Datasets will help you test your Machine Learning Skills?

Kaggle is a great place for hunting datasets but you cannot obviously start working with any dataset right off the bat so here are some particular datasets which can help you test your Machine Learning Skills if you just starting up with it.

### Any of these:
 * Titanic dataset(Classification Problem) [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
 * Iris Dataset(Classification Problem) [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)
 * MNIST Dataset(Image Classification Problem) [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
 * House Prices(Regression Problem) [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
